# Customer-Segmentation-For-A-Subscription-service-Project

### PROJECT TITLE: CUSTOMER DATA ANALYSIS FOR A SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE

### PROJECT OVERVIEW
To analyze and segment customers of a subscription service in order to better understand customer behavior, improve retention, and inform targeted marketing strategies. The segmentation will focus on identifying patterns across various customer attributes, including subscription type, revenue, cancellation and region. The insights will help the company enhance its customer experience, and optimize revenue generation.

### DATA OVERVIEW
The customer data used in this analysis includes:
1. Customer ID/Name: This is a unique identifier for each customer to differentiate their individual data record.
2. Region: This is the geographical area where the customer is based. Which helps to identify regional trends and preferences.
3. Subscription Type: This is the category of subscription such as Basic, Premium, and stahdard. This reflects the service tier each customer has opted for and this would help in understanding customer distribution across product tiers.
4. Subscription Start: This is the date when the customer started their subscription. This allows us to analyze customer tenure and identify lifecycle patterns.
5. Subscription End: This is the termination date. This data helps in understanding subscription duration.
6. Canceled Status: This indicate whether a customer has canceled their subscription. This will enable us to know the number of customer that are active versus churned customers.
7. Revenue: The total revenue generated from each customer over the subscription period. This information allows for segmentation based on revenue contribution.
